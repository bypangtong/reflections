When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to promote my project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes I just want to change something on my project, but I want to
keep it on my own and do not want others to see it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is the function on GitHub just like the clone.
When I want to clone other's project on GitHub, I will use fork.
When I want to download the project in my repository I will clone.
When I want to add a new experimental feature to my project, I will use branch.
