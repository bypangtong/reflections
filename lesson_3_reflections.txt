When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to promote my project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes I just want to change something on my project, but I want to
keep it on my own and do not want others to see it.
